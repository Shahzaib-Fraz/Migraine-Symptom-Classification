Migraine Symptom Classification
This project aims to classify types of migraine based on a wide range of symptoms and clinical observations. Using a dataset containing various symptom patterns, we trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict the migraine type for a given patient input.

💡 What is a Migraine?
A migraine is a neurological condition that causes intense, debilitating headaches often accompanied by symptoms like nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and visual disturbances. Migraine types can vary significantly, including:

Migraine with Aura

Migraine without Aura

Chronic Migraine

Vestibular Migraine

Hemiplegic Migraine

Early identification of migraine type can help guide effective treatment strategies.
